External I/O Ports
------------------

DC-In Jack
~~~~~~~~~~

The mainboard comes with a coaxial power connector on the real I/O panel
adjacent to the Micro SD slot. The power connector carriers +12VDC ~ +24VDC
external power input. The specifications and pinout of the power connector
are shown below.

Micro SD Card Slot
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Micro SD card slot is located on the rear I/O panel, it offers expandable
storage.

Mini USB 2.0 Port
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are two integrated Mini USB 2.0 ports located on the rear I/O panel. The
Mini USB 2.0 interface port gives complete Plug and Play and hot swap
capabilities for external devices and it complies with USB UHCI, rev. 2.0. Each
Mini USB port uses the USB Type AB receptacle port connector. The pinout of
the typical Mini USB port is shown below.

Mini HDMI® Port
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The integrated 19-pin Mini HDMI port uses an HDMI Type C receptacle
connector as defined in the HDMI specification. The Mini HDMI port is for
connecting to HDMI displays. The pinout of the Mini HDMI port is shown
below.

RJ-45 LAN port (Fast Ethernet)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The integrated 8-pin Fast Ethernet port is using an 8 Position 8 Contact (8P8C)
receptacle connector (commonly referred to as RJ-45). The Fast Ethernet ports
are controlled by VIA VT6113 10/100 Base-TX PHY chip controller. The
pinout of the Fast Ethernet port is shown below.

Onboard Connectors
------------------

DC-In Connector
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The mainboard has an onboard DC-In 2-pin power connector to connect the
DC-In power cable. The DC-In power connector is an optional power
connector in addition to the DC-In jack on the rear IO panel. This provides
two methods for delivering +12VDC ~ +24VDC to the mainboard. The pinout of
the DC-In connector is shown below.

SIM Card Slot
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The mainboard is equipped with a SIM card slot located on the top side of the
board which can support a 3G SIM card. Using the SIM card slot on VAB-600
requires a 3G module installed in the Mini Card expansion slot to enable the
3G function, otherwise the SIM card slot is disabled. The SIM card slot is
designed only for 3G module without built-in SIM card slot on it. The SIM
card slot is labeled as "SIM1". The pinout of the slot is shown below.

Battery Charger Connector (Optional)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The mainboard is equipped with an onboard battery charger connector used
for connecting the external cable for charging a rechargeable battery. The
battery charger connector is labeled as "CN3". The connector pinout is shown
below.

RTC Battery Connector
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The mainboard is equipped with an onboard RTC battery connector used for
connecting the external cable battery that provides power to the 32.768KHz
crystal oscillator for Real Time Clock (RTC). The RTC battery connector is
labeled as "BAT1". The connector pinout is shown below.

Front Panel Pin Header
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The front panel pin header block consists of 6 pins. It provides access to the
system power LED, power switch and shut down switch. The front panel pin
header is labeled as "CN7". The pinout of the pin header is shown below.

GPIO and I²C Pin Header
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The GPIO and I²C combination pin header block labeled as "CN9" is used for
connecting the I²C device, and eight General Purpose Input and Output. The
pinout of the combination pin header is shown below.

SPI Flash Connector
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The mainboard has one 8-pin SPI flash connector. By connecting to the SPI
BIOS programming fixture, the SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) flash connector
can update the SPI flash ROM. The connector is labeled as "SPI1". The pinout
of the connector is shown below.

USB Connector
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The mainboard includes one onboard USB connector designed for connecting
the wireless LAN USB module. The connector is labeled as "CN11". The
pinout of the connector is shown below.

COM Connector

Front Audio Pin Header
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Mini Card Slot
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

4-Wire Resistive Touch Screen Connector
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Key PAD Connector
